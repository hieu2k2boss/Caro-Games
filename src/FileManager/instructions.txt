A. Game Setup:
    1. Board: The game is played on a grid that is 10x10 squares.
    2. Players: There are two players. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O".

B. How to Play:
    1. Starting the Game
        Decide who will go first. The first player will place their mark ("X") in an empty square on the grid.
    2. Taking Turns
        Players will take turns placing their mark in one of the empty squares.
        Once a mark is placed, it cannot be moved or removed.
    3. Winning the Game
        The first player to get five of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
    4. Draw
        If all squares are filled and no player has five marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
